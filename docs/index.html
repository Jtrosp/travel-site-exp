            <h2 class="headline headline--no-t-margin">Here&rsquo;s how we got started&hellip;</h2>
            <p>We meet while working on a security contract overseas. A common topic of discussion was the marksmanship qualification course of fire to remain on project. Being that we were all former military, we knew that dry fire training had to be part of the solution. We wanted our solution to encompass individual marksmanship techniques to be sure. However, we didn&rsquo;t stop there! We wanted a training solution that provides freedom of movement and is scalable to develop team techniques and SOP&rsquo;s as well. Other requirements included no blank ammunition required, realistic trigger pull and reset, allow an issued upper receiver to be mounted on the training device. This means that soldiers, police officers, and civilians can train with the same rifle configuration they go on duty, or compete, with. No need to transfer optics, lasers, and lights to a training rifle! With all these requirements in mind, we developed the <strong>Rifle, Dry Fire</strong> (RDF) training device.</p>
            <p>With an unwavering commitment to safety and realistic training we developed, and patented, the RDF to go anywhere. With all these requirements built into the RDF, we feel its strongest asset is that it allows the user to training anywhere with no logistical support required! The RDF allows individuals, and teams, the ability to take their hip-pocket training, or pre-mission rehearsals to the next level. The users can literally throw the RDF in their duffel bags, or trunk, and train anywhere they go!</p>
            <p>As former infantry soldiers, we believe that the RDF is an invaluable training product. If properly implemented into marksmanship training programs, the RDF will save the military, law enforcement, and civilians many times their current time, money, and ammunition they already spend on their rifle training programs! As ammunition becomes more expensive, so will cost training! The RDF enables realistic individual, and team, training that cuts the ever growing cost of rifle training. So, instead of going to the range hoping that your team is trained, with the RDF know that they are trained!</p>

            <h3 class="feature-item__title">Safety</h3>
            <p>The RDF is a training device. During the design process, we added specific features that prevent the firing of live ammunition while training with the RDF. These safety features do not detract from realistic rifle techniques. We also thought it was just as important for the RDF to develop proper muscle memory, and movement techniques for team safety as well.</p>

            <p>Between the five of us, we have traveled the entire planet and we don&rsquo;t know of a single place where the RDF can&rsquo;t go. Where ever you take your rifle, the RDF can go with you, and your team! The RDF was also designed to keep the logistical requirements to a minimum!

            <h3 class="feature-item__title">Individual and Team Training</h3>
            <p>The RDF has the same look and feel as other lower receivers. While attached to an upper receiver, the RDF maintains all the functionality of an issued rifle. Thus, all individual modern rifle techniques can be performed realistically. Likewise, with multiple units, training can be conducted at the team level dynamically with no cap on team size.</p>

            <p>The RDF concept, and patents, allow for multiple rifle platforms. This gives the RDF concept the flexibility to be implemented into foreign military units that use other than M16/M4 rifle platforms. Please read the RDF product proposal for more information.

              <p>The RDF was originally designed with the military infantry in mind. However, virtually all service members train with, and are issued, a M16/M4 rifle. Also, the flexibility of the RDF concept allows it to be compatible with many foreign military rifle platforms as well. The RDF allows these men and women to train safely, dynamically, and develop proper marksmanship fundamentals.</p>

              <p>The M16/M4 rifle platform is widely used in local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. They are used in patrol and tactical units alike. Implementing the RDF into the training of these men and women will improve individual, and team, tactics and techniques. The RDF will help these law enforcement agencies save time, money, and ammunition on the training range. </p>

              <p>In recent years, the M16/M4 rifle platform has become a popular choice among civilians. There are many competitions that have developed around these platforms as well. So, the RDF is a great option for training civilians on proper gun handling techniques. likewise, competition shooters can take their dry fire training sessions to the next level. The techniques they use in competition are the same techniques they can use with the RDF.</p>
